# Assessment-of-MSD
This is just assessment for the course on Managing Software Development. So do not use all of this code please!

This code is about how to create images in NovelAI based on the number and label I requested, but I don’t want to use this feature that comes with NovelAI because it requires me to keep an eye on the web page, and I want people to be able to use NovelAI’s image generation tool more conveniently when they work.
So in the end I decided to create this code that can continuously create images.
I will use python and try to make a web scraping tool through XPATH. In order to use it more conveniently, I may try to use PyQt5 to make a GUI for this code.
