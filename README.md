# Assessment-of-MSD
This is just assessment for the course on Managing Software Development. So do not use all of this code please!

This code is about how to keep creating pictures according to the number and tags I request in NovelAI, but I don't want to use this function comes with NovelAI because it costs me a lot.
So finally I decide to create this code that can keep creating pictures.
I'll use python and try to make a web scraper by XPATH, and for more convenient to use it, may be I'll try to make GUI for this code by using PyQt5.
